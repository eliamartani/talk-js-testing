# Testing VueJS projects

## About

This little talk is to measure the importance of creating tests on our projects and eventually helping us to avoid from making mistakes in the future

## Tools

Jest, Vue Client, etc.

## Installing Jest through Vue CLI

Execute the following command. Sit and wait 'til everything is done, or just go get a coffee :coffee:

```cmd
vue add @vue/unit-jest
```

It'll create some files structuring the whole project to start working with tests

### Disclaimer

Old projects may face issues since it doesn't use Vue CLI

My suggestion: Install it manually or just add `vue-cli-service` to your project

```cmd
yarn add @vue/cli-service --dev
```
